---INSTRUCTIONS---

-- Everything is Pink? Why is that happening? --
By default, this asset comes as HDRP.
If you are using Basic RP or Universal RP, you will need to switch some files around.
To learn how to switch, please read the next steps below:


**SWITCHING RENDER PIPELINES**

1.) Install your Render Pipeline if you have not already.

2.) Switch to your Render Pipeline in the Project Settings.
2.a) If using Basic, ensure that your color space is Linear
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html

3.) Inside the "OceanEnvironmentPack" folder, I want you to delete all folders except for the "Textures" folder
So delete these folders:
- Materials
- Meshes
- Prefabs
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Shaders
- Sound


4.) Inside the "OceanEnvironmentPack" folder, you'll find two packages.
Extract your chosen Render Pipeline Package
(Choose from the following)
- BasicRP Patch
- URP Patch

6.) Now you can open your levels! Locate them in:
Assets/Davis3D/OceanEnvironmentPack/Scenes

----------------

If you switch the files around and it still isnt working, it may be that the latest Unity version does not support the Shaders of this package.

In that case, a recompile of the shaders using Amplify Shader Editor is required.
We do not expect you to own Amplify Shader Editor, and we take responsibility for doing this.

So if you encounter this issue, please check the following Google Drive folder for any potential Shader updates before emailing me at admin@etheriondesigns.com
